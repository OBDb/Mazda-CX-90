    description: "The Mazda CX-90 represents Mazda's new flagship three-row SUV in North America, based on a newly developed Large Product Group platform featuring a longitudinal engine layout and rear-wheel-drive-based architecture. As the largest and most powerful mass-production Mazda ever sold in North America, it replaces the CX-9 while offering more interior space, capability, and premium features. The exterior design evolves Mazda's KODO design language with elegant proportions emphasized by a long hood, cab-rearward stance, and clean surfacing with minimal character lines. The CX-90 debuts Mazda's new inline-six engine in North Americaâ€”a 3.3L turbocharged unit with a 48-volt mild hybrid system producing 340 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque in its standard form, with a Performance variant producing an upgraded 280 horsepower for certain markets. A PHEV option combines a 2.5L four-cylinder engine with an electric motor for a total system output of 323 horsepower and an electric-only range of approximately 26 miles. Both powertrains pair with a new eight-speed automatic transmission and standard i-Activ all-wheel drive with expanded capability including off-road modes. The interior showcases Mazda's most premium approach to date with Nappa leather, genuine maple wood, and traditional Japanese textile inspirations like hanging stitches on the dashboard. Technology features include a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, 12.3-inch central touchscreen (that reverts to rotary controller operation while driving), available 12-speaker Bose premium audio, and a comprehensive suite of i-Activsense safety features. With three rows of seating for up to eight passengers (or seven with second-row captain's chairs), it offers significantly more interior space than the CX-9 it replaces, particularly in the third row. The CX-90 positions Mazda further upmarket, competing more directly with premium three-row SUVs while maintaining the brand's focus on driving dynamics, design, and craftsmanship."
